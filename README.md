# UFO Sightings
The purpose of these project is to create a website that makes available to the public a comprehensive database detailing UFO sightings, with all the particular details.

# Results
Since the database is extensive, a simple table displaying the results is both not appealing and impractical for the user, so through the use of a javascript code, the display table can be dynamically built, displaying filtered data selected by the user.

Also, because many information is available for each sighting, the use of many filters is warranted, so the user can select geographical filters or date filters, in order to narrow down the search.

Website (home):

Bootstrap 3 elements were incorporated into the HTML code in order to make it vissually appealing.

# Summary
As with any new project, many problems can be encountered, and one drawback is that two information categories cannot be incorporated for filtering: duration and comments.
Since the duration is variable in every UFO sighting, the data is not precise and is not uniformly entered into the database, so a simple filter for the user is not possible to incorporate.
The comments section contains variable descriptions of each sighting, so there is no concise filtering elements.
One additional recomendation could be to incorporate links to the original images or footage (if there are any) so the user can have access to them.
Also an option to export and download the filtered data can be a nice experience for the user.
